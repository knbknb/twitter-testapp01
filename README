This is my first github repo that I created from the command line.
The code shown here is just for practicing.
The first exercise is developing an app for the Twitter API.
To use the twitter API, you need to register an app, however trivial it might be.
Don't know if the URL is really validated at  api registration time.
In any case, the app will be for private use. 

Aside from that, there is nothing to see here, please move along.
