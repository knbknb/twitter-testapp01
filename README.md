## Synopsis
Download some tweets as JSON.

## Remarks

This was my first github repo; I created it in 2011; it is just a simple command-line app written in Perl. 

This app is for my own personal use.

The code shown here was just for practicing, 
  1. for learning to interact with github.com, and 
  2. to develop a perl app for the Twitter Search API.
  3. to learn the basics about OAuth (v1)

To my understanding, to use the Twitter API at all, you needed (at least in 2011) to register an app with a valid URL to some  website, however trivial the app might be.

Registering an app is required for getting OAuth credentials, comprising 4 "Passwords": The (App) Access Token, its Secret; and the Consumer token, the Consumer Token Secret. I still use these credentials in other projects. 

So, this is the main purpose for keeping this online. I don't think the app itself was really validated by a Twitter employee/bot anytime, but there has to be a homepage for the app - this page at github.com.
or if you just needed to provide an URL to a github repo. A script at Twitter might have verified its existence, 
or if it is be necessary for some OAuth mechanism to work.

Meanwhile, Twitter might have changed its authorization requirements, or some details of the authentication procedure.

In any case, the Perl app was just for private use. 

Take a list of Person's full names, and for each one, return some metadata-profile  and tweets as JSON data. 
Save entire JSON response to a file.


**The app probably no longer works; there is nothing to see here anymore**.
