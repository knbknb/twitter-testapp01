twitter-testapp01
=========
This is my first github repo; I created it in 2011; it is just a simple command-line app written in Perl. 

The code shown here was just for practicing, 
  1. for learning to interact with github.com, and 
  2. to develop an app for the Twitter search API.
  3. to learn the basic s about OAuth 

To my understanding, to use the Twitter API at all, you needed (at least in 2011) to register an app with a valid URL, however trivial the app might be.
Don't know if the app itself was really validated by a Twitter employee/bot at app-registration-time, 
or if you just needed to provide an URL to a github repo. A script at Twitter might have verified its existence, 
or it mught be necessary for some OAuth mechanism  to work.
Meanwhile, Twitter might have changed its authorization requirements.

In any case, the Perl app is just for private use. 

Take a list of Person's full names, and for each one, return some metadata-profile  and tweets as JSON data. 
Save entire respnse them to a file.



Aside from that, there is nothing to see here, please move along.
