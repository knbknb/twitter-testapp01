twitter-testapp01
=========
This is my first github repo; I created it in 2011; it is just a simple command-line app written in Perl.
The code shown here is just for practicing.
The first exercise is developing an app for the Twitter API.
To use the twitter API, you need to register an app with a valid URL, however trivial the app might be.
Don't know if the URL is really validated at app-registration-time.
In any case, the app will be for private use. 
Meanwhile, Twitter might have changed its authorization requirements and mechanisms

Aside from that, there is nothing to see here, please move along.
